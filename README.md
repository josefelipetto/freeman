This is my initiative to stop all the non-sense productization of API Development Platforms. This has no future and we're only squeezing them to get some money and be VC backed up. This is not a sellable product, it's just a utility, it must be open source, it must be evolved by the community and not any financial motive. I want to make this process cool. It needs to be cool to do requests. Maybe we can reduce for demands of systems that could be easily replaceable by this, because it only queries something in an API. 

I just want to create a collection, create some requests and be happy.
I like the tools of creating tests, using values from different requests, create requests flows (e.g: POST /auth + grab the token from the response then POST /product).
I like the idea of sharing this over the cloud, but I don't want to login, create an account, share my data with some company to store in their servers, 
I simply don't want to have all this steps just to do a simple request. I want this tool to be used both by developers but less technical people as well, like product managers, etc.

This must be simple. The user must open the app and know what to do. If I want to create a collection, it must be easy. If I want to create an environment, it must be easy. 
If I want to create requests inside collections, it must be extremely easy. If I want to add vars and then edit, I must open the app and just know what to do. 

I want to be able to syncronize these collections with my peers, but I don't want any servers of my own managing third-party data. Maybe the user can provide a S3 bucket, a remote file system,
something that we can store the file and do the version control of it (only upload the differences). As a user of a collection, I should be able to update it to get the latest version.
